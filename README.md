# Citibike Traffic Accidents (NYC) Map

I built an interactive map showing NYC traffic accident locations (from 2020), color-coded by borough. 
This was built using:
- HTML/JavaScript
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for mapping
- GeoJSON data for accident locations. 

First off, I wanted to finally build a simple-enough application that could help me learn JavaScript more thoroughly and plot thousands of accident points across NYC. Users can also zoom in/out and click to see by borough. I obtained the geospatial data from NYC's opendata, and then cleaned/converted it into GeoJSON.

The goal of this visualization is to:

- Plot thousands of accident points across NYC. 
- Lets users zoom, pan, and click to explore by borough. 
- Use open data!
